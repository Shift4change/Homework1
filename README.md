# Homework1
1. in Html i replaced <div> tags with elements such as <header>, <section>, <article>, <aside> 
and <footer>.
i wasn't able to replace <span> tag "<h1>Hori<span class="seo">seo</span>n</h1>",
 with <nav> element. 
2. in css i used the names of the elements and added some classes and id's
 
thank you for your time! In God We Trust
